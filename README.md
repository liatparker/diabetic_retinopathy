# diabetic_retinopathy
Image processing classification 

### Description 
Image processing with very few data (200 for train, 50 for validation and 50 for test out of 1200 images)
using pretrained data from imagenet.


### How to run
1.Git clone the files to your computer ( Because I added augmentation to the keras preprocessing documentation,
  it has to be saved and imported between files,the added augmentation increased the accuracy from 0.86-0.88 to 0.90-0.92 )
  and also save  the pickle files ( they are saved model and weights).
 
2.Download the train, test, and validation data from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h_8JVH7UN9GCdgTe0MAYJx5XiVY4A_8)
  and save it your the directory.
  
3.Run the diabetic_retinopathy.py file.
